# smart-building-viewer

Can you create an app that shows buildings in an map (full screen), and that when I click on the buildings it shows the a card on top of the map that displays information about the building derived from proptech sensors. Make sure the map shows norwegian buildings (10 of them). Use dummy data fro the sensor data for now
